# User story analysis and definition of the use cases 
This repository relates to the analysis of the user stories submitted to I-ADOPT in order to derive a set of formalised use cases.

A core group of I-ADOPT members worked on this task in March 2020 and presented a highlight of the outcome at the I-ADOPT virtual session at the RDA virtual Plenary 15 on 19th March 2019. 

We have so far identified a set of 14 use cases and 4 use case groups. The details can be seen in this [file](https://github.com/i-adopt/usecase_analysis/blob/master/UCG.csv).

Please create an issue ticket if you want to start a discussion about any aspect of the user story to use case analysis or the content of the file.

The use case labels are used to label the user stories submitted [here](https://github.com/i-adopt/users_stories/issues).
