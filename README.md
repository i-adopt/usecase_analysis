# User story analysis and definition of the use cases 
This repository relates to the analysis of the user stories submitted to the I-ADOPT WG via our [user story repo](https://github.com/i-adopt/users_stories/) in order to derive a set of formalised use cases.

A core group of I-ADOPT members worked on this task in March 2020 and presented a highlight of the outcome at the [I-ADOPT session at RDA 15 Virtual Plenary](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/vocabulary-services-ig-interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-0) and can be browsed in slides 7-16 of this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u5iKwnTJdSpExJdrLR-xE2Cv3x3mGY-yM6kNc1xEav4/edit#slide=id.g713d01d5e9_2_45).

We have so far identified a set of 14 use cases and 4 use case groups. The details can be seen in this [file](https://github.com/i-adopt/usecase_analysis/blob/master/UCG.csv).

Please create an issue ticket if you want to start a discussion about any aspect of the user story to use case analysis or the content of the file.

The use case labels are used to label the user stories submitted [here](https://github.com/i-adopt/users_stories/issues).
