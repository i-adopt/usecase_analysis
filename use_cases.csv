1;terminology generation and curation;1.1;Semantic modelling;develop terminology to represent concepts formally
1;terminology generation and curation;1.2;Terminology management;gather, curate and maintain terminologies
1;terminology generation and curation;1.3;Semantic alignment;align concepts from terminologies using established relationships and preserve the mappings
1;terminology generation and curation;1.4;Terminology search;search and retrieve relevant terminologies/terms
2;resource annotation;2.1;Data annotation;Manual or automated process (might have different requirements if so then split into 2 use cases). Could be done in real- or near-real time when the data are generated and subsequently transformed or in delayed mode either by the scientists themselves or by the data manager in the course of standardising incoming data formats.
2;resource annotation;2.2;Metadata annotation;Manual or automated process (might have different requirements if so then split into 2 use cases). This is not coupled with data creation. Automation or semi-automation would require text mining. This would be mainly used for annotating large volume of legacy data and mapping source variables with standardised names
2;resource annotation;2.3;Annotation service provision;provision of annotation tools and services
3;data discovery and exploration;3.1;Semantic data search;select appropriate data records for download or further online manipulation (like e.g. intergation) based on search criteria that target a particular set of observable properties
3;data discovery and exploration;3.2;Semantic data exploration;select appropriate data records for visual display based on search criteria that target a particular set of observable properties
4;Data manipulation and integration;4.1;Data integration;Combine datasets from various sources based on semantic information - could target one specific kind of data or multiple kinds of data; needs to support merging criteria (i.e. exclude/include based on a particular set of criteria) and retention of source information
4;Data manipulation and integration;4.2;Data model alignment;Select appropriate data sets for use with physical computational models by combining data search and integration
4;Data manipulation and integration;4.3;Data cleaning;use semantic information to carry out data quality control
